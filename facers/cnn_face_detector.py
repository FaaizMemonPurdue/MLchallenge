#   This example shows how to run a CNN based face detector using dlib.  The
#   example loads a pretrained model and uses it to find faces in images.  The
#   CNN model is much more accurate than the HOG based model shown in the
#   face_detector.py example, but takes much more computational power to
#   run, and is meant to be executed on a GPU to attain reasonable speed.
#
#   You can download the pre-trained model from:
#       http://dlib.net/files/mmod_human_face_detector.dat.bz2
#
#   The examples/faces folder contains some jpg images of people.  You can run
#   this program on them and see the detections by executing the
#   following command:
#       ./cnn_face_detector.py mmod_human_face_detector.dat ../examples/faces/*.jpg
#
#
# COMPILING/INSTALLING THE DLIB PYTHON INTERFACE
#   You can install dlib using the command:
#       pip install dlib
#
#   Alternatively, if you want to compile dlib yourself then go into the dlib
#   root folder and run:
#       python setup.py install
#
#   Compiling dlib should work on any operating system so long as you have
#   CMake installed.  On Ubuntu, this can be done easily by running the
#   command:
#       sudo apt-get install cmake
#
#   Also note that this example requires Numpy which can be installed
#   via the command:
#       pip install numpy

    This detector returns a mmod_rectangles object. This object contains a list of mmod_rectangle objects.
    These objects can be accessed by simply iterating over the mmod_rectangles object
    The mmod_rectangle object has two member variables, a dlib.rectangle object, and a confidence score.
    
    It is also possible to pass a list of images to the detector.
        - like this: dets = cnn_face_detector([image list], upsample_num, batch_size = 128)

    In this case it will return a mmod_rectangless object.
    This object behaves just like a list of lists and can be iterated over.
